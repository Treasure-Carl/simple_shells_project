<h1>Blazers: Treasure-Olayinka and Hosea-Favour</h1>
<h3>Description</h3>
A simple UNIX command interpreter that replicates functionalities of the simple shell (sh). Additional functions are also included. This program was written entirely in C as a milestone project for ALX Africa Software Engineering.

<h3>Installation</h3>
Clone this repository into your working directory. For best results, files should be compiled with GCC and the following flags: -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu89

<h2>Usage</h2>
After compilation, the resulting program can run stand-alone, either in interactive or non-interactive mode.

<h2>Interactive Mode</h2>
In interactive mode, simply run the program and wait for the prompt to appear. From there, you can type commands freely, exiting with either the "exit" command or ctrl-D.

<h2>Non-Interactive Mode</h2>
In non-interactive mode, echo your desired command and pipe it into the program like this:

<h2>echo "ls" | ./shell</h2>
In non-interactive mode, the program will exit after finishing your desired command(s).

<h2>Included Built-Ins</h2>
Our shell has support for the following built-in commands:

<h3>Command Definition</h3>
exit [n]	Exit the shell, with an optional exit status, n.
env	Print the environment.
setenv [var][value]	Set an environment variable and value. If the variable exists, the value will be updated.
unsetenv [var]	Remove an environment variable.
cd [dir]	Change the directory.
help [built-in]	Read documentation for a built-in.
